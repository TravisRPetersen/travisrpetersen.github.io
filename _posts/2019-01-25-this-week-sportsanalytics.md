This Week in Sports Analytics:

In a nod to one of my favorite shows as a kid, [This Week in Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_in_Baseball), I wanted to take some time every week to review interesting developments in Sports Analytics.  

I wrote this up before I realized [StatSheetStuffer.com](https://twitter.com/StatStuffercom) compiled their own [weekly roundup](http://statsheetstuffer.com/weekly-sports-analytics-news-roundup-january-22nd-2019/).  I will do my best to try to make sure there isn’t too much overlap and certainly refer to theirs every week as well!

### Baseball

* At MLB we’re looking to hire a manager for the [Machine Learning team](http://www.mlb.com/careers/mlbam/?gh_jid=1206615&gh_src=27f9d9861).  We have a lot of exciting projects coming up and we’re putting together a great team (biased here) of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and computer vision experts.  It’s a great opportunity to help build the future of Statcast.

### Basketball

* Justin Jacobs took a look at using Manifold Learning to [analyze styles of players](https://squared2020.com/2019/01/16/a-methodology-for-qualitatively-comparing-games/).  He walks through the rebounding responsibilities for the Detroit Pistons.

### Football

* The CMU Sports Analytics club, in a project led by Sarah Mallepalle released [next-gen scrapy, a NFL tracking data web scraping repository](https://www.cmusportsanalytics.com/introduction-to-next-gen-scrapy/).  This will allow the public to get access to all of the passing tracking data and they have future plans to include wide receiver route locations.

* Sean J. Taylor, Manager of Core Stats team at Facebook, took a quick look at [play calling efficiency of NFL coaches](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1086343041743372288).  As he demonstrates, many coaches are too conservative on second down, often optimizing for first downs when they should be optimizing for yardage gained.


### Soccer

Joe Gallagher, Data Scientist at vTime, [took a look at adjusting xG per possession](https://jogall.github.io/2019-01-16-adjusted-xG/) with an eye towards improving on possessions containing multiple shots.  His analysis of the England/Tunisia world cup game using free data from StatsBomb was particularly interesting.

### Hockey

Hockey Graphs had a magnificent 3 part explainer on how they developed their WAR statistic for hockey.

[Part 1](https://hockey-graphs.com/2019/01/16/wins-above-replacement-history-philosophy-and-objectives-part-1/) discussed the history of WAR, [Part 2](https://hockey-graphs.com/2019/01/17/wins-above-replacement-the-process-part-2/) discussed their statistical plus-minus based strategy, and [Part 3](https://hockey-graphs.com/2019/01/18/wins-above-replacement-replacement-level-decisions-results-and-final-remarks-part-3/) reviewed their replacement level assumptions and finalized methodology.  The data for the model can be found on their [Evolving Hockey website](https://www.evolving-hockey.com/).

### Other

[Rocío Joo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05935) compiled a list of 57 movement tracking packages within R and provided recommendations. While the wealth of packages is impressive, they recommend “integration over proliferation” to encourage researchers to evaluate how a new package fits within the ecosystem[(h/t Luke Bornn)](https://twitter.com/LukeBornn/status/1086153744272609280).
