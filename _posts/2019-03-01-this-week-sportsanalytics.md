This Week in Sports Analytics:

[StatSheetStuffer.com’s](https://twitter.com/StatStuffercom) weekly roundup is [here]( http://statsheetstuffer.com/weekly-sports-analytics-news-roundup-february-26th-2019/).

### Baseball

[A. Solomon Kurz](https://solomonkurz.netlify.com/post/stein-s-paradox-and-what-partial-pooling-can-do-for-you/) walks through the classic [Stein’s Paradox](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/Article1977.pdf) paper and how partial pooling of multilevel models help create better batting average estimates.

### Basketball

[Nathan Sandholtz](https://twitter.com/nsandholtz) and [Jacob Mortensen](https://twitter.com/jwmortensen) introduce lineup points lost and lineup point lost contributions to measure efficiency in shot allocation in their Sloan paper titled [“Chuckers: Measuring Lineup Shot Distribution Optimality Using Spatial Allocative Efficiency Models”](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chuckers-1.pdf).

### Football

The NFL Big Data Bowl concluded on Wednesday and there was a lot of [great work](https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/2019-big-data-bowl-winners-announced/).  I was particularly interested in the Expected Hypothetical Catch Probability model that Katherine Evans and Sameer Deshpande put together.  Katherine has put together an explanation of the work in [part 1 of a planned 4 part series](https://causalkathy.com/2019/02/27/expected-hypothetical-catch-probability-part-1/).

### Hockey

Prashanth Iyer put together an [RShiny App](https://piyer97.shinyapps.io/RAPM_Career_Animated_Plots/) to visualize RAPM data from Evolving Hockey.  While baseball has had WAR for over a decade, it is fun to see other sports work on developing their own public versions.  

### Soccer

Javier Fernandez, Luke Bornn, and Dan Cervone [“Decompose the Immeasurable Sport”]( http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decomposing-the-Immeasurable-Sport.pdf) by constructing a model that quantifies the expected value of any soccer possession at a frame-by-frame level.  [Luke Bornn](https://twitter.com/LukeBornn) and his lab have consistently put out great work at the Sloan Analytics Conference and he put together a [twitter thread on all 11 papers over the last 5 years](https://twitter.com/LukeBornn/status/965986388863631360). 

### Other

Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking is a must read for anyone looking to learn Bayesian statistics.  He recently finished posting his 2019 course lectures [here](https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath/status/1101433074213158912).
