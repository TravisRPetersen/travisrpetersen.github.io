This Week in Sports Analytics:

[StatSheetStuffer.com’s](https://twitter.com/StatStuffercom) weekly roundup is [here]( http://statsheetstuffer.com/weekly-sports-analytics-news-roundup-february-5th-2019/). 

### Baseball

Alex Caravan and Dan Aucoin walk through results of combining HitTrax (swing outcome) and BlastMotion (swing characteristics).  They were able to find some very strong relationships [between data gathered from both systems.](https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/02/pairing-blast-hittrax-data/) Looking forward to part 2.

I enjoyed Austin Rochford’s code for [generating park factors.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/AustinRochford/a2f1566719fc8d6f15562c181743226f)


### Basketball

Justin Jacobs walks through using [Kullback-Leibler Divergence](https://squared2020.com/2019/02/07/an-example-in-kullback-leibler-divergence/) to compare how shooting frequency distributions differ between players.  As always he’s thorough on not just the underlying theory and math, but also the applications where KL-Divergence could be useful in the realm of player decision making. 

### Football

[SeanfromSeaback](https://twitter.com/SeanFromSeabeck/status/1092527699493412864) reported on one of the most exciting plays from Super Bowl LIII. The longest punt in Super Bowl history from former Oregon State Beaver (Go Beavs!) [Johnny Hekker](https://twitter.com/SeanFromSeabeck/status/1092528167422590976).  His analysis from the [NFL Data Bowl](https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/big-data-bowl/) demonstrates how punts that are able to make a returner move more are more likely to end in a downed punt.


### Soccer

Jacob Beckett [@jacobbeckett22](http://twitter.com/jacobbeckett22) took a crack at modeling the odds for the [CONCACAF Champions League](https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/home/2019/2/5/what-it-takes-to-win-the-champions-league) at American Soccer Analysis.  As a Sounders fan, I'm bummed we don’t get to participate but I will be rooting for the MLS clubs to be the first to win the league.


### Other

[David Miller](https://twitter.com/millerdl) published a breakdown of GAMs called “Bayesian views of generalized additive modeling”. The paper is focused on the Bayesian interpretation of the mgcv R package implementation.  Other implementations include [BAMLSS](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1407325), an example with [brms](https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2018/04/21/fitting-gams-with-brms/), and a python implementation called [pyGAM](https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).  GAMs can be a useful tool in baseball analysis as Jim Albert showed back in [January 2018](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2018/01/15/chance-of-hit-as-function-of-launch-angle-exit-velocity-and-spray-angle/).
